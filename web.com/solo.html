In this case study I will be looking at how unemployment interferes with economic growth of a country. I will be comparing employment
 levels in developed countries like the USA, France, Germany etc with unemployment levels in developing and less developed countries like 
 Kenya and Uganda respectively. I will also looking at economic growth on African countries and compare it to their respective levels of 
 unemployment in order to establish the relationship between the two. I <strong>will further narrow down</strong> to how unemployment has been a stumbling
 block towards economic growth in Kenya. I shall look at the major causes of unemployment in Kenya as well as the remedies that the government
 can put in place to curb this menace. I further breakdown unemployment into different categories and do a deep analysis to each type to determine 
 its causes and provide solutions for the same. I shall compare different
 economic growth rate of a country through a series of time in years and compare it to their respective unemployment levels at that time.
